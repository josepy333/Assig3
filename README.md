Card:  A class like the one presented in the modules, but with a few changes.
Hand:  A class that represents the cards held by a single player.
Deck:  A class that represents the source of the cards for dealing and, as the 
      game progresses, the place from which players can receive new cards (say, as they pick cards 
      "from the deck" or when future hands are to be dealt from the same deck).  Recall this picture, 
      which relates the Deck to the various Hands that it creates through the process called "dealing".
The dealer uses a Deck object to deal Hand objects to the players.  The dealer may or may not be a player 
who gets a hand of his own (poker dealers in casinos don't receive a hand, but most other games involve the dealer getting a hand).
